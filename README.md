# UI/UX Exercise for Puppet

Coding assignment found [here](https://github.com/Distelli/ui-ux-exercise1).

## Notes
* In UI_UX_Specs.pdf, the text dictates the font color for the table header ("LIST HEADER") should be #95A2AA. However, the color shown in the mock-up is actually #282653. Used font color dictated in spec sheet.
* Functionality added outside of spec sheet:
    * Click an already sorted category header reverses sort order.
    * Table allows for horizontal scrolling for overflow on tablets and mobile phones.
    * Top navbar and filters stack and center on mobile phones.

## Built With
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
